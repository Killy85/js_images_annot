# Easy annotation tool

This project aim at creating an easy to use, yet powerfull annotation tool.

The main goal is to publish a quite technicaly afforcable solution when you are in need for annotating stuff on images.

This is quite important because it may be one of the best way to gather informations for machine learning algorithm today when you are not a big company: Creating an open-source project and let interested enough people contribute to it by labelling data.

In design, this element will be dependent of a server side application, which may render this page later.

To run this, just download the project and open the index.html file with a browser.

It is not beautiful atm, and it really do kind of nothing, but that's just the beginning.
